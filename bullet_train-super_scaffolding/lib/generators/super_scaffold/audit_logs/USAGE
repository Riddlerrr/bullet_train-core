Description:
  Generate files needed to add an audit log to a model.

Example:
  E.g. Add audit logs to Posts from a Team.
    rails generate super_scaffold:audit_logs Post Team name:text_field

  The attributes you specify will be added to the _version partial and used to show different versions of the model.

  This will create:
    db/migrate/20241115152914_add_project_to_activity_versions.rb
    app/views/account/projects/_version.html.erb'.
  And update:
    app/models/project.rb
    app/models/activity/version.rb
    app/views/account/projects/show.html.erb
    app/models/activity/version.rb
    config/routes.rb
    app/controllers/account/projects_controller.rb

üèÜ Protip: Commit your other changes before running Super Scaffolding so it's easy to undo if you (or we) make any mistakes.
If you do that, you can reset to your last commit state by using `git checkout .` and `git clean -d -f`.
